Title: Shut Up and Escape With Me
By: Edwin Ho, Peter Truong, and Efren Aguilar

Programming for Hack UCI 2015

"Shut Up and Escape With Me" is our virtual reality horror labyrinth game that we created for Hack UCI. The project was programmed with C# and the engine used is Unity. It was a team project and was coded within the allotted time from 10:00 PM on Friday to 11:00 AM on SUnday.

The first part of our project required us to utilize the Oculus VR camera object and to be able to manipulate it with our character model. We decided to create a randomly generated maze for different levels of our game to make it unique for every playthrough. 

Afterwards, we added the enemies and our actual player model with special mechanics. These mechanics included the ability to mark walls with three unique symbols to serve as helpful tools for the player. We also added a drone that allows you to scout out the ghouls hiding beneath the ground. The drone will pass any ghoul during its travel time and leave behind a cloudy red aura symbolizing the presence of a ghoul. The ghouls will climb and attack the player, adding to the horror aspect. 

We hope you enjoy our game!
